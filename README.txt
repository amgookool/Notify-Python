Notification Problem 
So we want to notify the caregivers to administer the medication of a patient at the prescribed time a doctor gave.

The parameters to determine if an alert is sent are:

Occurance: 
The occurance is the daily scheduling of the patient medication instruction.
A doctor can assign specific days (eg Mon,Wed,Fri) or use keywords like 
weekdays to signify Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri
and 
weekend to signify Saturday and Sunday

Frequency:
The frequency is the amount of times a medication needs to be administered each day.
eg 3 times a day , 10 times a day , etc
